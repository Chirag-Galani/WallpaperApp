# WallpaperApp

I plan to implement an application with a user interface complying with the latest Material Design Guidelines by Google 

I have decided to use the following components to develop this application:
* Kotlin
* RxJava
* LiveData
* WorkManager
* MVP
* Dagger 2
* Other Android Jetpack components
  
## Todo:
* Setup the Kotlin application
* Setup the Android Jetpack
* Integrating the Cloudinary API to fetch the folders and images from the CDN
* Design & implement the main screen grid to display the recent wallpapers as the MainActivity
* Design & implement the wallpaper view for the application with support for download, Crop, set wallpaper and lockscreen. 
* Setup [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) and [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) architecture componenents to store & fetch the app information in the SQLite database 
* Implement pagination on the grid view while accessing the directories & wallpapers using [Paging Architecture component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/)
* ...and many more to come
